# CDK Application Repository Module

The application repository (or "apprepo") module is a set of APIs to facilitate
a standard for application packaging, deployment, and execution within the
Hadoop ecosystem.

__This module is a prototype__ under active discussion and development and is
exempt for any stability or compatibility guarantees that apply to the rest of
the CDK. End users should __not__ depend on any code that currently exists.
Those interested in participating in its development should check out the
[design draft](design.html).
